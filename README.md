# my-business-calculator
Instead of manually calculating the Business profits for me and my brother on a Notepad, I decided to code a Calculator for it.

I will create a calculator that will let you save a Document, and will calculate the Business profits for me and my brother and allow me to fill in the Date of the Amazon Period + the Date of the Calculation.
